Honestly this doesn't need much of a write up. Done similar stuff to this and muscle memory kicks up to tell that is an dp problem. All we need to do is keep track of index and number of changes done already.
Index can go from 0-n and number of changes can go from 0-k.
So dp[n][k] just track these and handle it. We go each step and see what changes can be done and we evaluate if it is valid and move onto the next stage step by step while keeping memory of previous steps.

And again this can be optimised by keeping a prefix sum so we don't have to add each time.
This can be understood as:
Maintaining a DP array where dp[i][j][l] represents the number of ways to make the first i bits of the string equal, using j operations, and l is a flag indicating whether I have made the current segment of bits equal or not. The segments are defined by the positions that have been flipped.

But instead we can just have a prefix sum and compute the sum and reduce complexity.
